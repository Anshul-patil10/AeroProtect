# 🌍 AeroProtect — AI-Powered Air Quality Intelligence

AeroProtect is a **cinematic, AI-driven atmospheric intelligence platform** designed to transform invisible air pollution data into actionable health insights. Built for the **AIColegion Hackathon 2026 (VESIT)**, it combines real-time sensory data with machine learning to predict, explain, and guard against environmental threats across India.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔮 Predictive Intelligence
- **6-Hour AQI Forecast**: Uses machine learning to predict atmospheric trajectory.
- **Explainable AI (X-AI)**: Transparently shows which pollutants (PM2.5, NO₂, etc.) are driving the forecast using feature importance scores.

### 🛡️ Personalized Health Guard
- **Persona-Aware Assessments**: Tailored health logic for the General Public, Children/Elderly, and Athletes.
- **AI Briefings**: Human-readable explanations of current conditions and protective protocols.

### 🗺️ Cinematic Live Heatmap
- **Nationwide Coverage**: Real-time AQI visualization across **45+ major Indian cities** and a high-density **10x10 regional grid scan**.
- **Smooth Gradient Rendering**: Advanced Heatmap implementation for a professional, "vibrant" aesthetic.
- **Geographically Bounded**: Precisely calibrated for the Indian subcontinent.

### 📊 Professional Analytics
- **Historical Deep-Dives**: 7-to-30 day trend analysis for multi-pollutant tracking.
- **Intelligent Search**: Fuzzy location matching with geometric bounding for India-only results.

## 🔮 Future Scope & "Student Scale" Reality

### Limitations (The Student Scale)
- **API Constraints**: Currently relies on the WAQI API which has a default programmatic quota of **1,000 requests per minute** (with bursts up to 60 requests). Full-scale commercial deployment would require a dedicated institutional agreement.
- **Hosting**: Designed as a local-first development project; scalable cloud hosting (AWS/GCP) for the ML models and data ingestion is planned for post-competition.
- **Sensor Density**: While we use 250+ official stations, hyper-local street-level data is currently limited by public station availability.

### Future Roadmap
- **📍 DIY IoT Integration**: Support for low-cost PM2.5 sensors (ESP32/Arduinos) for community-driven data.
- **📱 Mobile Ecosystem**: Cross-platform Flutter/React Native app with "High Pollution" push alerts based on live location.
- **🌦️ Met-AI Sync**: Integrating real-time wind speed and humidity from OpenWeatherMap to improve 24h forecasting.
